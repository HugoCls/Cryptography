## Classical Cryptography

### 1. [OTP (One-Time Pad)](https://github.com/HugoCls/Cryptography/tree/main/OTP)
The One-Time Pad is a theoretically unbreakable cipher that uses a single-use pre-shared key as long as the message being sent.

### 2. [Caesar Cipher](https://github.com/HugoCls/Cryptography/tree/main/Caesar)
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

### 3. [Vigenere Cipher](https://github.com/HugoCls/Cryptography/tree/main/Vigenere)
The Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.

### 4. [Baptista Cipher](https://github.com/HugoCls/Cryptography/tree/main/Baptista%20Cipher)
The Baptista Cipher is a block cipher based on chaotic dynamics, often used for image encryption.

## Quantum Cryptography

### 1. [BB84](https://github.com/HugoCls/Cryptography/tree/main/BB84)
The BB84 protocol is the first quantum key distribution scheme, providing secure communication based on the principles of quantum mechanics.

### 2. [E91](https://github.com/HugoCls/Cryptography/tree/main/E91)
The E91 protocol is another quantum cryptography protocol based on quantum entanglement for secure communication.

## Public-Key Cryptography

### 1. [Diffie-Hellman](https://github.com/HugoCls/Cryptography/tree/main/Diffie-Hellman)
The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel.

### 2. [RSA](https://github.com/HugoCls/Cryptography/tree/main/RSA)
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission.

### 3. [Classic McEliece](https://github.com/HugoCls/Cryptography/tree/main/Classic_McEliece)
The Classic McEliece algorithm is a code-based public-key cryptosystem, considered to be resistant to attacks by quantum computers.
